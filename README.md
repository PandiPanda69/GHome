GHOME
=====
Green Home is a 4IF students project proposed for the first time by our INSA Lyon teacher-researcher.
W'll try to make it real and fonctionnal.

Who is it for?
--------------
Anyone with a server at home and who can afford buying SunSpot and EnOcean sensors. 
So few dandy now, but hopefully this will be the kind of stuff we'll see in every housse in the 10-20 coming years.
